# nursing_home_analysis

The goal of this project is to analyze the nursing home data provided by the Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) and create visualizations to communicate the resource constraints faced by the nursing homes.

Data is provided by CMS: https://data.cms.gov/covid-19/covid-19-nursing-home-data

The analysis is followed by steps:
1. Conduct the distribution of facilities by counties and states
2. Conduct a state level analysis on shortage of aides, clinical staff, nursing staff and other staff
3. Conduct a state level analysis on availability of eye protection, gloves, hand sanitizer, N95 masks, surgical masks, and ventilator supplies
